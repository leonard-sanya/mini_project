## Predicting Underserved Regions in Kenya: A Machine Learning Approach to Healthcare Facilities Distribution.

## Abstract

This project investigates the spatial distribution of healthcare facilities in Kenya and its relationship to population needs by integrating diverse datasets, including the 2019 Census population data, county boundary GeoJSON files, and healthcare facility records. Additional geographic features are extracted from OpenStreetMap to enrich the analysis. The study follows the *Accessâ€“Assessâ€“Address* framework: data are accessed and preprocessed, assessed through exploratory data analysis, visualization, and correlation checks, and then addressed with predictive modeling. Logistic Regression and NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifiers are applied to identify underserved regions, with model performance evaluated using ROC curves and confusion matrices.

##  Project Overview
The study follows the **Access â€“ Assess â€“ Address** framework:

1. **Access**  
   - Load and preprocess datasets:  
     - Kenya 2019 Population Census (per county)  
     - Kenya County Boundaries (GeoJSON)  
     - Healthcare Facility Registry  
     - OpenStreetMap (OSM) features such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship  

2. **Assess**  
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
   - Standardize and merge datasets by county  
   - Correlation analysis to detect redundant or highly related variables  
   - Feature importance evaluation for underserved prediction  

3. **Address**  
   - Train predictive models (Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes)  
   - Evaluate performance with **ROC curves**, **confusion matrices**, and accuracy metrics  

---

##  Key Results
- Successfully merged heterogeneous datasets into a unified framework.  
- Logistic Regression and NaÃ¯ve Bayes effectively predicted whether a county was underserved.  
- Visualizations revealed counties with limited health facilities relative to population needs.

##  Data Sources
- **Population Data (2019 Census)** â€“ [HDX Kenya Population Dataset](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kenya-population-per-county-from-census-report-2019)  
- **Healthcare Facilities Data** â€“ [EnergyData.info](https://energydata.info/dataset/kenya-healthcare-facilities)  
- **County Boundaries** â€“ [Kenya County GeoJSON](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/json-repository/resource/51939d78-35aa-4591-9831-11e61e555130)  
- **OpenStreetMap Features** â€“ Extracted using [OSMnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/)

---

## Libraries
- **Python**: Pandas, Geopandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: OSMnx, Shapely  
- **Workflow Framework**: Access â€“ Assess â€“ Address methodology  
I see the issue ðŸ‘€ â€” itâ€™s with your **code block fencing** in step 1.

You opened the block with **\`\`\`bash** but closed it with \*\*\`\`\`\` (four backticks instead of three). That breaks Markdown formatting, so everything after can look off.

   cd mlfc_miniproject
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Distribution_of_healthcare_facilities_in_Kenya.ipynb
   ```
